# Rice Mush

Rice Mush isn't so much a recipe as it is an easy to make, adaptive, leftover-reducing, 
food substitute.  Rice Mush can be made with a large variety of ingredients.

## Ingredients

+ Rice.  This is the only constant.  Your anchor; your rock.
+ Something containing a tomato-based sauce, or tomato sauce of some kind.
+ Some other stuff (vegetables, meat, cheese, wood shavings)

## Directions

1. **Cook the Rice:** Start by steaming some rice.  In case you're clueless and don't
   know how, start by putting a cup or so of rice in a pot, fill it so that the water
   reaches about 1 inch above the rice, turn the stove on high, bring to a boil, turn
   the heat to low, cook until there's no water left.
1. **Based Tomatoes:** Time to get creative.  At this stage, you'll want to heat up
   some kind of tomato-based sauce.  This can be leftover spaghetti sauce, leftover
   chili, salsa, whatever you have.  Feel free to throw some hot sauce, black pepper,
   or whatever in there to give it a little kick.
1. **By Our Powers Combined:** Congratulations, this is the last required step.
   Combine the tomato whatever and the rice together.  Pat yourself on the back.
   Next stop, Iron Chef.
1. **Optional Additives:** If you'd like you can throw some other shit in there too.
   Maybe some grated mozza on top, of some fried green peppers, or onions, or a can
   of tuna.  Depends what you have, and what you used as a tomato base.
1. **Eat:** Get that shit in your belly.  You've conquered the kitchen.
