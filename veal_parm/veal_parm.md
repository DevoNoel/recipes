Adapted from [marthastewart.com](http://www.marthastewart.com/331764/chicken-or-veal-parmigiana)

## Ingredients

+ Veal scallopini, 1/8 inch thick
+ Mozzarella cheese
+ 1/2 cup of parm
+ 1 jar of tomato-based sauce
+ 1 and 1/2 cups bread crumbs
+ 1 cup flour
+ 4 eggs
+ Pasta
+ Vegetable oil
+ Salt and black pepper

## Directions

1. **Bread the cutlets:** Combine breadcrumbs, parm, 1/2
teaspoon salt, and some pepper. Put flour, eggs, and breadcrumb mixture in 3
separate dishes. Dredge cutlets in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in egg,
letting excess drip off. Dredge in breadcrumbs to coat. Let stand for 25-30
minutes.

1. **Fry the cutlets:** Heat oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches,
fry cutlets until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to baking sheet.

1. **Bake the dish:** Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Top cutlets on baking
sheet with about 1 cup sauce, covering each piece. Top generously with
mozzarella. Bake until cheese is bubbling and melted, about 7-8 minutes.

1. **Pasta:** Bring a pot of water to boil.  Sprinkle in salt, add pasta.  
Boil until done, about 10 minutes.  Drain water.  Place pasta back in the pot.  
Add the rest of the jar of sauce.

1. **Put it all together:**  Eat your food.  Do the dishes.  Be grateful for
your blessings.
