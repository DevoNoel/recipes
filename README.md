# Recipes

A list of recipes I like, written in markdown.  Recipes for eating, I'm not
talking about Chef here. Poached from other sites, adapted to my personal
tastes.  Without all the adds and bloat and bullshit of 99% of recipe websites.

+ [Chicken Stew](chicken_stew/README.md)
+ [Veal Parm](veal_parm/README.md)
