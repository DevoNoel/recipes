Here's a nice [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6BHiiuyXCs) showing it being made.

## Ingredients

+ 1 yellow onion, diced
+ 3 gloves of garlic, or garlic powder for the lazy
+ 2 carrots, peeled and chopped
+ 2-3 sticks of celery, chopped
+ 5-6 white mushrooms, diced
+ Leftover steak, stew beef, or something similar, cubed
+ Tall can of Guiness or some other dark beer
+ 3 tbsp flour
+ Rosemary, salt, pepper
+ Half a block of cheese (mozza, havarti, whatever)
+ Ready made puff pastry, enough for shell and top
+ 1 egg

## Directions

1. **Prepare the filling:** In a dutch over, fry the onions in oil.  Add the carrots, celery, mushrooms, and meat.
Seaison and brown the meat first if you like, but not required. Once the veggies have softened a bit, pour in a tall
can of dark beer. Add 2-3 tablespoons of flouri and spices. Add enough water (or some kind of stock) to just cover the ingredients.
Simmer, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Bake for 1h 30m.  Take out, stir.  Bake for another 30ish minutes, until stew
begins to thicken.  Add more flour if necessary.

1. **Prepare the pie crust:** On a clean, dry surface, spread out some flour and roll your premade puff pastry out.
Place it at the bottom of a pie dish.  You'll probably want something fairly deep to hold all your filling. Crack an
egg, and with a brush, apply a coating to the edges of the pie shell. Then, roll out some pastry for the top of the pie.
Score it lightly with a knife in a crisscross pattern, and also coat the top of it with egg.

1. **Add the filling:** Take a generous amount of cheese and stir it into your filling.  Let it cool a bit.  Spoon the filling
into your pie crust.  Top with a bunch more cheese.  Plop your pastry top on top of this, and fold the corners over the top.
Put back in the over for 40-45m, until top is puffy and golden.

1. **Eat up buttercup:** Why haven't you just switched to a Soylent only diet yet?  So much less work.
