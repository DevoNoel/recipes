# Chicken Stew

A recipe of my own making.

## Ingredients

+ 4 chicken breasts halves
+ Carrots
+ Celery
+ Onions
+ Potatoes
+ Garlic
+ Chicken stock
+ Corn starch or flour
+ White wine, brandy, spiced rum or beer
+ Vegetable oil
+ Salt and black pepper
+ Spice to taste

## Directions

1. **Prepare the chicken:** Cut the breasts into bite-sized chunks.
Spice liberally.  Don't be shy, no such thing as too much flavour in a stew.
Kneed the chicken to work the spices in.

1. **Cook the chicken:**  In a large pan, heat vegetable oil.  Sear the
chicken.  It doesn't have to be completely cooked, but most of the pink should
be gone.  Transfer into crockpot.  Add more spices on top.

1. **Add greens:**  Chop carrots, celery and onions, as much as you want, lay
on top of chicken. Mince garlic, 3 or 4 cloves.  Chop potatoes.  Don't worry
about peeling them, just wash them and chop them.  Add to pot.

1. **Liquid:** Add chicken stock, add alcohol, add two or three cups of water.
About 70% of the food should be submerged in liquid.  Add more spice.

1. **Cook:**  Cook on low for 8 hours, or on high for 6.

1. **Thicken:** Add a tablespoon of corn starch or flour to thicken.  Stir in,
let cook 5-10 minutes.  Repeat until desired thickness.

1. **Serve:** Eat. Talk with your family. Contemplate the heat death of the
universe.
